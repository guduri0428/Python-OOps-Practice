# If the Value of the variable is not varied from object to object, such type of variables
# we have to declare within the class directly but out side of any methods.
# Such type of variables are called Static variables.

# For total class only one copy of static variables will be created and shared by all objects of the class.

# We we access static variables either by using class name or by using object reference. But recommended 
# to use the class name.
